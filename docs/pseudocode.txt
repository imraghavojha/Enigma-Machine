Initialize Plugboard:
    Set each letter to map to itself.

Define Rotor Structure:
    Fields: normal, scrambled, position, init_position.

Function: Rotate Column (rotor_array)
    Shift all elements of the rotor array one position.

Function: Rotate Rotor (rotor)
    Rotate both normal and scrambled arrays.
    Update rotor's position.

Function: Initialize Rotor (rotor, config, init_config)
    Set rotor's normal array as A-Z.
    Set scrambled array based on config.
    Rotate rotor until its starting letter matches init_config.

Function: Check and Rotate Rotors (left, middle, right)
    If right rotor completes one full rotation, rotate middle rotor.
    If middle rotor completes one full rotation, rotate left rotor.
    Rotate right rotor every time.

Function: Step Through Rotor (rotor, position)
    Forward path: Get scrambled letter from the rotor.
    Find its index in the rotor's normal array.

Function: Step Through Rotor Reverse (rotor, position)
    Reverse path: Get normal letter from the rotor.
    Find its index in the rotor's scrambled array.

Function: Reset Rotors (left, middle, right)
    Rotate each rotor back to its initial position.

Function: Encrypt Letter (left, middle, right, reflector, input, plugboard)
    Pass letter through plugboard.
    Rotate rotors.
    Forward path through right, middle, left rotors, and reflector.
    Reverse path back through left, middle, right rotors.
    Pass letter through plugboard again.

Function: Encrypt Message (left, middle, right, reflector, message, plugboard)
    For each letter in the message:
        Encrypt it using Encrypt Letter function.

Main Program:
    Initialize plugboard.
    Initialize rotors: left, middle, right, and reflector.
    Display Menu:
        1. Encrypt Message:
            Reset rotors.
            Encrypt input message.
        2. Decrypt Message:
            Reset rotors.
            Encrypt input message (same process as encryption).
        3. Configure Plugboard:
            Swap two letters in the plugboard.
        4. Set Rotor Positions:
            Reset rotors to user-defined positions.
        5. Exit Program.
